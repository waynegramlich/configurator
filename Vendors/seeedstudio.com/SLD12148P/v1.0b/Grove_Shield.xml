 Brief="22 port Grove Base Shield">
  <Overview>
    This is the new version of Electronic Brick Shield.  We standardize
    all the connectors into 4 pins (Signal 1, Signal 2, VCC and GND) 2mm
    connectors, which simplify the wiring of electronics projects.
    The 4 pin buckled connectors also make the wiring situation more
    stable.  We build all kinds of Twigs to match up with Stem, so
    you do not need to worry about the compatibleness between the stem
    and your existing Electronic Bricks.  We have many kinds of converter
    cables (still increasing) to deal with the compatibleness.  This is
    very similar in fashion to an Arduino shield board, and in fact is
    used as such with our Seeeduino or Mega board.  In v1.0b, we move
    in the analog connectors a little so that it will fit the higher
    power connector and USB connector.

    Base Shield is compatible with Seeeduino or Arduino UNO and Duemilanove.
