 Brief="Grove Thumb Joystick">
  <Overview>
    The Grove Thumb Joystick is a Grove compatible module which
    is very similar to the 'analog' joystick on PS2 (PlayStation 2)
    controller.  Two direction movements will output different
    analog signals as they are actually two potentiometers.
    The resistor is ~10k for each.  The joystick also has a push
    button that is could be used for special applications.  When
    the module is in working mode it will output two analog values
    representing two directions. The value is restricted in a little
    smaller range (e.g 200~700)compared to the normal joystick,
    while it is around 1023 when the button is pushed, so that
    the MCU can detect the action of pressing.
