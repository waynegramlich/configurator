 Brief="22 port Grove Base Shield">
  <Overview>
    The Grove Base Shild is an Arduino(tm) compatible shield
    that has 22 Grove connectors on it.  7 of the connectors
    are connected to the A0-A5 shield pins.  13 of the
    connectors are connected to pins D2-D13.  1 connector is
    dedicated to D0-D1 for serial communication.  The final
    is really not compatible with the Grove architecture at
    all; all 4 pins are connected to D10-D13 for SPI communication.
    This shield is a "top shield" in that other shields can not
    be plugged into it.
