 Brief="Grove Slide Potentiometer">
  <Overview>
    This slide potentiometer is a linear variable resistor with a
    total resistance of 10k.  When you move the lever from one side
    to the other, its output voltage will range between 0 V to the
    VCC you apply.  Three of four Grove pins are connected to VCC,
    GND and the ADC IN on the slide, while the remaining pin is
    connected to a green indicator LED.  You can use the indicator
    LED to visually display the change on the potentiometer.
