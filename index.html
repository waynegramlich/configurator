Introduction

								<P>
Configurator is a program that is used to configure
modules that make up an electronic project.  At this
point in main window looks as follows:

The main window has three sub windows:
								<UL>LI>
    The left window is a "database" of available
    modules.  Currently modules can be selected by
    Vendors, Categories, or by Buses.  Currently,
    the MBDuino module is selected.
								</LI><LI>
    The center window is the project window that
    shows the project as nested tree of interconnected
    modules.  The project is hosted by Raspbery Pi
    computer, that has a RasPi bridge that connectes
    between the Raspberry Pi GPIO connector and a
    MakerBus.  There are 4 modules plugged into the
    MakerBus -- LCD_Duino, Grove_Duino, TinkerKit_Duino,
    and DemPer_Duino.  All of the modules are
    Arduino<Sup>&trade;</Sup> compatible board into which
    shield can be plugged.  The LCD_Duino has an
    LCD shield plugged into it and the Grove_Duino
    has a Grove shield plugged into it.  All names
    in the project tree are specified by the project
    designer.
								</LI><LI>
    The right window is called the module window and
    it allows the Configurator to perform remote
    procedure calls and examine registers on the
    selected module.  The currently selected module
    is highlighted in the middle window.  The [Get],
    [Set], and [Call] buttons are used to directly
    access the module.  Currently, the user has
    just sent the letter 'H' to the LCD module via
    the <Em>character_send</Em>() remote procedure
    call.

								</LI></UL>
That should provide enough of an overview for now.
