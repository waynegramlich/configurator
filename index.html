Introduction

								<P>
Configurator is a program that is used to configure
modules that make up an electronic project.  At this
point in main window looks as follows:

The main window has three sub windows:
								<UL><LI>
    The left window is a "database" of available
    modules.  Currently modules can be selected by
    Vendors, Categories, or by Buses.  Currently, 
    the Vendors section is open with modules from
    "adafruit.com", "sainsmart.com", and
    "seedstudio.com" being shown.  The LCD1602 was
    copied over to the the Project under "LCD_Duino"
    and renamed to "lcd".
								</LI><LI>
    The center window is the "Project" window that
    shows the project as nested tree of interconnected
    modules.  This project is hosted by Raspbery Pi
    computer, that has a RasPi bridge that connects
    between the Raspberry Pi GPIO connector and a
    MakerBus.  There are 4 modules plugged into the
    MakerBus -- LCD_Duino, Grove_Duino, TinkerKit_Duino,
    and Gadget_Duino.  All of the modules are
    Arduino<Sup>&trade;</Sup> compatible board into
    which shield can be plugge in MakerBus.  The
    LCD_Duino has an LCD shield plugged into it and
    the Grove_Duino has a Grove shield plugged into it.
    All names in the project tree names are specified
    by the project designer.
								</LI><LI>
    The right window is called the module window and
    it allows the Configurator to perform remote
    procedure calls and examine registers on the
    selected module.  The currently selected module
    is highlighted in the middle window.  The [Get],
    [Set], and [Call] buttons are used to directly
    access the module.  Currently, the user has
    just sent the letter '@' to the LCD module via
    the <Em>character_send</Em>() remote procedure
    call.

The [Generate] button is used to generate code for the
various modules.  For the example above, selecting one
of "LCD_Duino", "Grove_Duino", "TinkerKit_Duino", or
"Gadget_Duino" and clicking on the [Generate] button will
generate an Arduino<Sup>&trade;</Sup> .ino source file
that can be compiled and downloaded to appropriate
module.  In addition, clicking on the [Generate] button
when "RasPi" is selected, will generate a Python module
that provides interfaces to all of the modules on the
the MakerBus.  In addition, this Python module can be
executed as a stand-alone program and will generate a
GUI program (using Python Tkinter) that can directly
access all of the registers.  A first cut is shown below:

That should provide enough of an overview for now.

The source code is available via
    <A HRef="https://github.com/waynegramlich/configurator">
github<A>.  The know dependencies are:
								<UL><LI>
    Python 2.7 (Python 2.6 should work as well).
								</LI><LI>
    The appropriate idle (Python Integrated Deveolpment
    Environment) that comes with Python (the tree widget
    currently comes from idle.)
								</LI><LI>
    PySerial to talk to a serial port (USB or UART.)
    Currently, you only need to have PySerial installed.
    Configurator fails gracefully if it does not successfully
    open /dev/ttyUSB0.

The
    <A HRef="html/index.html">
source code documentation</A> is being converted to
    <A HRef="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">
Doxygen</A> format.  Doxygen version 1.8 is required
since much of the documentation is done in
    <A HRef="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">
Markdown</A> format (which was recently added to
Doxygen 1.8.)
